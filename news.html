<h4>British PM Election</h4> 
<p>Rishi Sunak wins the Conservative Party leadership race and is set to become the next UK PM.
The development follows weeks of turmoil; Sunak will be the third British premier in two months after Boris Johnson and Liz Truss resigned.
  Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank and an expert on British politics, says Sunak’s impending status as the country’s first ethnic minority prime minister is “a massive moment” symbolically.

“[But] his reputation will hinge on how well he delivers as PM at what is perhaps a uniquely difficult time in our history,” Menon told Al Jazeera.

“At a minimum, the South Asian community will take note because one of their own is in Downing Street, though ultimately they will judge him on his policies and there is no guarantee that his policies will be to all of their likings,” he added.

<h4>Russia-Ukraine war</h4> 
<p>Russia fired missiles and drones into the Ukrainian-held southern town of Mykolaiv, destroying an apartment block,
In a flurry of phone calls to Western defence ministers, Russia said the war was trending towards “uncontrolled escalation”.
Russia told people to flee from the occupied city of Kherson as more residents moved to escape an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. Moscow said its forces prevented a bid by Ukraine to break through its line of control. 
Russian defence minister Shoigu, in a call with NATO nations, said Moscow had concerns Ukraine could use a “dirty bomb” but gave no evidence.
The Russian-installed administration of the Kherson region announced the formation of a local militia, saying all men remaining in the city could join.

<h4>China’s GDP growth rebounds at faster pace in Q3, but risks loom</h4> 
<p>The data was originally scheduled for release on October 18 but was delayed amid a key Communist Party Congress last week, which ended with Xi Jinping securing a precedent-breaking third term as its leader.

“The Chinese economy has great resilience, potential and latitude,” Xi told reporters on Sunday as he unveiled the top leadership team of the Communist Party for the next five years.

“Its strong fundamentals will not change, and it will remain on a positive trajectory over the long run.”
